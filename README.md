## 1. Dataset Description
### Data Source
- Original dataset: `original_dataset.csv` (structured hiring records) with 11 feautres:
`Age,Gender,EducationLevel,ExperienceYears,PreviousCompanies,DistanceFromCompany,InterviewScore,SkillScore,PersonalityScore,RecruitmentStrategy,HiringDecision`
- Augmented with synthetic resume text via `generate_resume_text()` function in the `add_resume.py` file to allow the use of a text classification model.
- The Dataset was split into Training Dataset(70% Male,30% Female) and Testing dataset(30% Male and 70% Female) to implement representation imbalance in the training Dataset.

### Feature Encoding
| Feature | Encoding |
|---------|----------|
| Gender | 0 = Female, 1 = Male |
| Education | 1=HS, 2=Bachelor, 3=Master, 4=PhD |
| Recruitment | 1=Campus, 2=Job Portal, 3=Referral |

### Sample Resume Text
`
"female applicant, age 30.0. She has high school and 8.0 years of experience. She has worked at 5.0 companies and lives 39.9 km from office. She scored 18.0/100 in the interview, 51.0/100 on skill tests, and 25.0/100 on personality assessments. She applied via job portal" `

## Model Architecture & Performance
#### A simple TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model was used.

### 1. Pipeline Design
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```
# Baseline Model
```python 
baseline_pipe = Pipeline([
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(
        max_features=5000,
        stop_words=['male applicant', 'female applicant']  # Gender term removal
    )),
    ('clf', LogisticRegression(
        class_weight='balanced',
        max_iter=1000,
        random_state=42
    ))
])
```

# Debiased Model (Fairlearn)
```python
from fairlearn.reductions import ExponentiatedGradient
debiased_pipe = Pipeline([
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)),
    ('mitigator', ExponentiatedGradient(
        estimator=LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000),
        constraints=EqualizedOdds(),
        eps=0.1
    ))
])
```
# Model Performance
## Model Accuracy
### üß™ Baseline Model - No Debiasing

**Accuracy:** `0.8280`

| Class / Avg     | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Class 0**     | 0.89      | 0.85   | 0.87     | 521     |
| **Class 1**     | 0.70      | 0.77   | 0.74     | 235     |
| **Accuracy**    | ‚Äî         | ‚Äî      | 0.83     | 756     |
| **Macro Avg**   | 0.80      | 0.81   | 0.80     | 756     |
| **Weighted Avg**| 0.83      | 0.83   | 0.83     | 756     |
